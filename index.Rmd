# About {-}

This book includes some of the topics covered during the intensive course *Introduction to Bioinformatics* held in at Nagoya University in Dec 13-14, 2017. It does not try to be particularly comprehensive but to serve as a small guide for the students.

Some parts of these book are inspired by my edX lectures *Introduction to Systems Immunology*.
