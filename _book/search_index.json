Several topics are covered: Sequence analysis Omics analysis Structural analysis 1.1 Sequence analysis The main goal of sequence analysis is two answer questions regarding the nature of DNA, RNA and/or protein sequences. Are there any other similar sequences? What parts of the sequences are similar and which one are not? Can we see a conservation pattern among a set of sequences? An example would be a protein sequence for which we have no other information than its primary sequence (i.e. the sequence of amino acids bound by peptidic bound).

Mice are treated with either the drug or some placebo. Epithelial cells are isolated from the lungs and RNA is extracted. After amplification and convertion into cDNA we hybridize the samples to microarrays containing probes for &gt;55 thousand transcripts. This will give us an estimate of the expression profile for 55 thousand transcripts. If we have initially 3 samples per group, we will obtain a 55,000 x 6 matrix of expression values. How can we process and analyze this data in a way that avoids biases and gives us some information about the biological question of interest? 1.3 Structural analysis Structural bioinformatics deals with methods predicting the structure of biopolymers and their interactions with one another as well as with small molecules.

Software for MSA: MAFFT Clustal (Classic) MUSCLE 2.4 Domains and motifs Biological sequences contain regions of high similarity to other similar regions in other proteins. Sometimes this regios are small, accounting for a few aminoacids, and they are typically named motifs. In other cases the conserved regions are larger, and then are called domains. Domains are sometimes associated with some structurally motivated definition of domain. Sometimes however, the distinction between these two types of conserved regions is ambigous. Motifs and domains can be identified by using the information from a MSA. This is the approach followed in the Pfam database. Sections of MSAs containing the domain of interest are manually curated. These are used to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that learns how to recognize the same domain in other sequences. With that model, we can identify all sequences in a database containing that particular domain. The software HMMER implements HMM for the analysis of biological sequences. It can learn models representing motifs, domains or entire sequences. These models are used to search for sequences matching the models in databases. It can also be used to annotate the domains/motifs present in a sequence using a database of domains. PFAM uses HMMER and manually curated MSA of domains to generate a database of protein families (PFAM). 2.5 Phylogenetic methods "],
["omics-analysis-1.html", "Chapter 3 Omics analysis 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Microarrays 3.3 Next-generation sequencing 3.4 Mass spectromics methods 3.5 Single cell omics", " Chapter 3 Omics analysis This chapter gives a brief introduction on the most common omics technologies. 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Microarrays Microarrays were arguably the first of the “omics” technologies, starting a new generation of high-throughput analyses. This type of exploratory analysis enables the generation of new hypotheses that can be further tested, becoming one important source of knowledge discovery. Microarrays were the first technology to allow this and currently there is a wealth of experimental data available in public databases. There are over 50,000 samples for expression microarrays deposited in the NCBI gene expression omnibus (Figure 3.1). Figure 3.1: Number of submissions per year for various technologies. Microarrays are basically made of a solid surface with short oligonucleotides attached to it (see Figure 3.2). Each oligonucleotide has a specific sequence, complementary to a particular gene transcript. This makes the oligonucleotide a probe for the expression level of the target transcript. The solid surface is divided into regions forming an array. Each region has attached the same oligonucleotide and therefore measures the expression of a single transcript. Figure 3.2: Microarrays are made of oligonucleotide probes attached to a solid surface. Here we can see a typical microarray experiment protocol in more detail (Figure 3.3). The RNA extracted from the target cells is converted into cDNA using nucleotides with a fluorescence molecule attached. A hybridization reaction is performed to allow the labelled cDNA to bind to its complementary probes. The location of the hybridized probes is revealed by exciting the array with a laser. Only those regions with cDNA bound will emit fluorescence upon stimulation with the laser. Because the location and sequence of the oligonucleotides are known, the location of the fluorescence will tell us which transcript has been detected. Image analysis is performed to quantify the signal associated with each probe, obtaining an estimate of the transcript’s expression level. Analysis of the raw data involves preprocessing of the intensities (usually background correction and normalization) and statistical analysis. Variants of this basic protocol exist that use different labeling approaches, detection methods, amplification of original RNA, etc. Figure 3.3: Summary of typical microarray workflow. 3.3 Next-generation sequencing An important limitation of microarrays is that they are based on oligonucleotide probes for detecting expression. This means microarrays can only detect molecules for which a probe exists in the array. The probes in a microarray are based on our knowledge of the genome’s sequence at the time of microarray design. Because our knowledge is not perfect, microarrays often contain probes measuring things different to what were originally intended. This may lead to incorrect conclusions if the information about the most likely target sequence is not up to date. Instead of using a probe to quantify the presence of a DNA or RNA molecule, why not just sequence the molecule? The problem was that existing sequencing technology was slow and expensive. This motivated the development of so called next generation technologies, or NGS. 3.3.1 RNA-seq Let’s look into the fundamental concept behind all NGS technologies from the perspective of transcriptomics (Figure 3.4). Imagine this gene containing one intron and both 5’ and 3’ UTRs, and is transcribed into a messenger RNA. The RNA is extracted from the cell and converted into cDNA. This cDNA is used in microarray technology for the hybridization reaction. In NGS however, the cDNA is ligated to sequencing primers, and sequencing produces a set of short reads. Then, this reads are mapped back using sequence alignment, to some reference genome. The location and number of reads will reveal, after correcting from biases like sequencing depth and transcript length, which genes are being expressed and their abundance levels. There are many applications of NGS technologies. Next we will review two of the most popular. Figure 3.4: Summary of rationale behind NGS technologies. The most popular application of NGS technologies is RNA-seq, a technology to measure the transcriptome (Figure 3.5). This slide shows a summary of the typical RNA-seq protocol. Isolate and fragment the RNA. A sequencing library is generated by converting the fragmented molecules into double stranded cDNA and ligating sequencing primers to the ends. The cDNA library is sequenced, resulting in a lot of oligonucleotide sequences called “reads”. The reads are aligned to a reference genome. The coverage at each genome location is defined as the number of overlapping reads. This density is proportional to the original molecule’s concentration. Therefore, molecules found at higher concentrations will show larger “peaks”. Computational methods are used to quantify the peaks overlapping gene sequences. Statistical methods are used to identify genes with differences in expression level. Because we are not limited to pre-specified sequence probes we can use the NGS data to detect the expression of alternative splice variants, non-coding RNAs, genetic variants (or SNPs) and even the expression of uncharacterized transcripts. Also, if the reference genome information is updated, the original data can be realigned, never becoming obsolete and possibly revealing additional information. This versatility increases dramatically the amount of information that can be obtained from a single experiment, making RNA-seq one of the most widely used omics technologies. Figure 3.5: Summary of typical NGS workflow. 3.3.2 Example: Stat3 expression in macrophages exposed to IL10 In the following example we will look into an RNA-seq experiment in more detail. Figure 3.6 shows the mouse Stat3 locus including the exon/intron structure of the different transcripts as yellow boxes and lines. You can see also other genes nearby, like Stat5a. The expression level in resting and IL10 stimulated macrophages is shown as the peaks overlapping with the exons. Figure 3.6: Expression of Stat3 in macrophages exposed to IL10. Those peaks represent the density of reads mapping to the genome (Figure 3.7). The expression level can be computed from the area of the peaks. Here we see that the expression level of Stat3 is increased in IL10 treated macrophages. From this picture we can also see some of the difficulties found when interpreting this type of data. For example, which of all the Stat3 transcripts are expressed and which are regulated? Answering this question requires more sophisticated analysis and possibly additional experiments designed specifically to gather supporting evidence. Figure 3.7: Expression of Stat3 in macrophages exposed to IL10. In Figure 3.8 we can see more details for one of the samples, with the coverage and the aligned reads below. These dense grey boxes are the actual sequenced reads. Figure 3.8: Expression of Stat3 in macrophages exposed to IL10. Let’s take a closer look to this region near the first exon (Figure 3.9). You can see here this boxes indicating the length of the reads and the arrowed end the strand to which they align. If we take an even closer look we can see now the reads in more detail. From this picture you can verify that the coverage is the number of reads overlapping at each genomic location. Here the grey boxes indicate that the read sequence matches that of the reference genome to which they have been aligned. Some of these reads locations, however, show mismatches. These are probably sequencing errors, but if a location shows a mismatch consistently found in all reads it will suggest a SNP in the assayed specimen compared to the reference genome. Figure 3.9: Expression of Stat3 in macrophages exposed to IL10. 3.3.3 ChIP-seq Another popular NGS technology is ChIP-seq, which stands for chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by NGS sequencing. In ChIP-seq we aim to identify protein-DNA interactions. That is, we want to know the sequence of the DNA to which a DNA-binding protein binds. This information is critical to understand gene regulatory programs. For example, gene transcription is regulated by transcription factors that bind to specific regions in the genome, including gene promoters and enhancers. Also, histones represent another type of DNA binding proteins with important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Posttranscriptional histone modifications, like acetylation, methylation, and others, are associated with regulatory outcomes, like expression activation and repression. ChIP-seq enables to study many of these patterns at genome wide scale. The basic ChIP-seq protocol is shown in Figure 3.10. First, proteins are fixed to the DNA with, e.g. formaldehyde. Then, the chromatin is fragmented, leading to many small fragments free of proteins and some with proteins bound. Among the later ones, some will be bound to the target protein, that can be a transcription factor or a histone with some particular modification like H3K9me3 (tri-methylation of lysine in position 9 of the histone H3). Next, we use an antibody against the target protein for an immunoprecipitation, which allows us to obtain the proteins and the DNA sequences they are bound to. Then we remove the fixation and isolate the DNA. The rest of the protocol, cDNA library construction and sequencing are performed similarly to RNA-seq. Sequencing will produce sequence reads that can be aligned to the reference genome. The read peaks accumulating in DNA loci will reveal where the target protein was bound. Computational methods are used to identify and quantify the peaks. Statistical analysis will help us determine if there is differential binding between experimental conditions. Figure 3.10: ChIP-seq workflow. 3.3.4 Example: Stat3 binding in macrophages exposed to IL10 In the following example we can see an application of ChIP-seq to identify the binding locations of the transcription factor Stat3 in macrophages after exposure to Il10. As before, the Stat3 locus in the mouse genome is shown, together with the coverage for the Stat3 ChIP-seq experiment. We can see that Stat3 binds to its own promoter upon Il10 treatment, suggesting that it regulates its own expression. Figure 3.11: Stat3 binding profile around the Stat3 locus An important limitation of ChIP-seq is that it can only identify binding sites for a single TF or histone modification at a time. Another problem is that in eukaryotes, enhancers can be located far away from the genes they regulate, hampering the assignment of TF binding to target genes. Finally, the observation of protein binding to DNA does not demonstrate its functional relevance, which requires additional functional experiments. 3.3.5 Other NGS technologies Other NGS technologies are becoming popular in recent years. For example, TSS-seq and CAGE-seq are technologies that identify the 5’ cap structure of the processed mRNA, revealing the location of active promoters. Other technologies are able to reveal information about the chromatin. Chromatin accessibility can be assayed by means of either DNaseI digestion or by transposase reaction. In both cases the enzymes have a preference to react with open chromatin regions, with regions of close chromatin or protected by the binding of proteins being more resilient. This enables to map open chromatin and even the location of nucleosomes and binding of TFs if enough sequencing depth is performed. Nucleosome location can be more directly assayed by using the Mnase-seq protocol. Finally, the methylation of the DNA can be assayed by bisulfite sequencing. 3.4 Mass spectromics methods 3.5 Single cell omics "],
