Several topics are covered: Sequence analysis Omics analysis Structural analysis 1.1 Sequence analysis The main goal of sequence analysis is two answer questions regarding the nature of DNA, RNA and/or protein sequences. Are there any other similar sequences? What parts of the sequences are similar and which one are not? Can we see a conservation pattern among a set of sequences? An example would be a protein sequence for which we have no other information than its primary sequence (i.e. the sequence of amino acids bound by peptidic bound).

Mice are treated with either the drug or some placebo. Epithelial cells are isolated from the lungs and RNA is extracted. After amplification and convertion into cDNA we hybridize the samples to microarrays containing probes for &gt;55 thousand transcripts. This will give us an estimate of the expression profile for 55 thousand transcripts. If we have initially 3 samples per group, we will obtain a 55,000 x 6 matrix of expression values. How can we process and analyze this data in a way that avoids biases and gives us some information about the biological question of interest? 1.3 Structural analysis Structural bioinformatics deals with methods predicting the structure of biopolymers and their interactions with one another as well as with small molecules.

AAGGATGA AACGATAA ..*...*. 2.2.1 Comparing two sequences of different lengths 2.2.2 Smith-waterman (global alignment) 2.2.3 Needleman- (local alignment) 2.2.4 Blast 2.3 Multiple sequence alignment When we want to align 3 o more sequences together we have a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). In MSA there is more ambiguity in what determines a correct alignment. Software for MSA: MAFFT Clustal (Classic) MUSCLE 2.4 Domains and motifs Biological sequences contain regions of high similarity to other similar regions in other proteins. Sometimes this regios are small, accounting for a few aminoacids, and they are typically named motifs. In other cases the conserved regions are larger, and then are called domains. Domains are sometimes associated with some structurally motivated definition of domain. Sometimes however, the distinction between these two types of conserved regions is ambigous. Motifs and domains can be identified by using the information from a MSA. This is the approach followed in the Pfam database. Sections of MSAs containing the domain of interest are manually curated. These are used to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that learns how to recognize the same domain in other sequences. With that model, we can identify all sequences in a database containing that particular domain. The software HMMER implements HMM for the analysis of biological sequences. It can learn models representing motifs, domains or entire sequences. These models are used to search for sequences matching the models in databases. It can also be used to annotate the domains/motifs present in a sequence using a database of domains. PFAM uses HMMER and manually curated MSA of domains to generate a database of protein families (PFAM). 2.5 Phylogenetic methods "],
