The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Sequence analysis 1.2 Omics analysis 1.3 Structural analysis", " Chapter 1 Introduction Bioinformatics can be defined as the use of computational tools to answer questions in Biology. Several topics are covered: Sequence analysis Omics analysis Structural analysis 1.1 Sequence analysis The main goal of sequence analysis is two answer questions regarding the nature of DNA, RNA and/or protein sequences. Are there any other similar sequences? What parts of the sequences are similar and which one are not? Can we see a conservation pattern among a set of sequences? An example would be a protein sequence for which we have no other information than its primary sequence (i.e. the sequence of amino acids bound by peptidic bound).

Mice are treated with either the drug or some placebo. Epithelial cells are isolated from the lungs and RNA is extracted. After amplification and convertion into cDNA we hybridize the samples to microarrays containing probes for &gt;55 thousand transcripts. This will give us an estimate of the expression profile for 55 thousand transcripts. If we have initially 3 samples per group, we will obtain a 55,000 x 6 matrix of expression values. How can we process and analyze this data in a way that avoids biases and gives us some information about the biological question of interest? 1.3 Structural analysis Structural bioinformatics deals with methods predicting the structure of biopolymers and their interactions with one another as well as with small molecules.
