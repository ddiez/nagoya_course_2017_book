# Reproducible research

An important topic in Bioinformatics as a research tools is reproducibility. Bioinformatics pipelines typically require numerous steps in which different parameters can change and affect the results. Also, software sometimes gets updated and not always updates are backbard compatible in the sense that changes in the underlying algorithms results in changes in the results. It is desirable to use a system that encourages transparent reports that enable to repeat the steps used during a particular analysis in order to reproduce the reported results. In this chapter we briefly describe some of the tools used by the modern Bioinformatician to accomplish this.

## Git

### Github

## Literate programming

### RMarkdown notebooks

### Jupyter notebooks
