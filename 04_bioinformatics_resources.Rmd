## Gene Ontology

One important difficulty when dealing with Biological structures (molecules, organelles, etc.) is the vocabulary we use to described them. As this type of information accumulated different researches would tend to use slighly different ways to describe the same thing. In other cases they can use similar words to describe different things. These nuances make the descriptions often found in publications ambiguous making it difficult to determine the exact meaning of some assertion. This difficulty became more prominent once the amount of information increased dramatically with the advent of omics technologies, and the information about the biological stuff was the subject of computational analyses. There was a need for an standardized nomenclature, and that was the origin of the [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org) project. The purpose of the Gene Ontology project is stated in it web page:

>The Gene Ontology (GO) project is a major bioinformatics initiative to develop a computational representation of our evolving knowledge of how genes encode biological functions at the molecular, cellular and tissue system levels. Biological systems are so complex that we need to rely on computers to represent this knowledge. The project has developed formal ontologies that represent over 40,000 biological concepts, and are constantly being revised to reflect new discoveries. To date, these concepts have been used to "annotate" gene functions based on experiments reported in over 100,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers.

In particular:

>The Gene Ontology project provides a controlled vocabulary of terms for describing gene product characteristics and gene product annotation data from GO Consortium members, as well as tools to access and process these data.
